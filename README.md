# Dicee

## Summary
I've created a dice game where two dices are randomly roled when the page is refreshed. It then displays which players dice has won or if it was a draw.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Instructions to install
1. Pull code to local
2. Click on dicee.html to run the project

## Features
- Accessing & changing DOM on run with JavaScript
- Using JavaScript Math object

## Things to improve
- A button to roll the dice rather than refreshing the page
- A count/tally of which player wins the most
